This Apple Script Application helps to keep your Bluetooth Speaker's bluetooth connection active so that it does not turn off by itself. This Apple Script based application plays a 1-sec silent audio every 5mins.

## Steps to Install:
Just open the installer and drag the app into your Application folder (Typical Mac Way!)

Run the application and keep it active. Your Bluetooth Speaker will not get disconnected!

If you need to stop it, just Force Quit the application.
